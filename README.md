# macpro-auth

### Currently

- We have communicated with the IDM integration team on the CMS side. We have created a channel in CMS slack called `macpro-idm-intergation_discussion` which contains our team and the IDM integration team

- The IDM integration team has identified multiple paths we can take with their team depending on our needs, which is currently dependent on HCD research. We need to iron out if we want a google drive (multiple door) authentication approach or more of a unified entry through a ONEMAC application. HCD research will drive our discussions.
